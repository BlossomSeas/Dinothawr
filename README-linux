==========
Dinothawr
==========

Dinothawr is a game that is implemented as a libretro core for RetroArch.
It is not a plain executable, but rather a dynamic library which RetroArch will run.

===================
Install RetroArch:
===================

If your distro has a RetroArch package, you can install that.

If not, the recommended way is to build from Git:
https://github.com/Themaister/RetroArch (Repo: git://github.com/Themaister/RetroArch.git)
See README or Wiki pages for how to build and install it.

Dependencies: Make sure you have OpenGL headers, X11 headers, etc. Basic stuff.

===============
Running game:
===============

To run the game. RetroArch needs to load a library of the Dinothawr engine, and
the dinothawr game as a "ROM".

Example:
   retroarch -L libretro-dinothawr-linux-x86_64.so dinothawr/dinothawr.game

=========
Source:
=========

Source of Dinothawr will be released when game is finished.

==============
Save data:
==============

Normally, RetroArch saves game data to same folder as where the "ROM" is loaded from.
If this folder is read-only (e.g. /usr/lib), save data cannot be saved.

If this is the case, you can override the path to save data using -s flag. E.g.:
   retroarch -L libretro-dinothawr-linux-x86_64.so -s ~/.dinothawr-save-data /usr/share/dinothawr/dinothawr.game
